# Shady
Shady is a glsl shader tool heavily inspired by shadertoy.

## Features
- Hot Loading Shaders (press F5)
- Accessable Uniforms (Time, Window Size, Mouse Position)

## How to build
use premake5 to build project files (currently vs2019 is the only supported build system...).

```premake5 vc2019```

## Development
Shady is early in development, currently this is a personal project. I will
be adding/making shady better when I feel like it.

Graphics programming is a interest of mine. I'm using shady to aid me in learning
graphics programming concepts.
